# trivia-game

This project is an exploration of using fltk to create a Windows app that interacts with the file system, parses xml,
and displays them in sections. The initial version of this is for creating questions and saving the format.

## QAML

QAML is the Question Answer Markup Language built for this project. It uses multiple tags to track sections, rules,
questions, answers, and any files that may need to be imported. Sample versions of this format will be provided with all
included features of the format.
